# Gideon-VoiceAssistant
Making my own smart voice assistant, Gideon.

Currently the project is still under developent.

List of current features:
- Uses the Google speech-to-text API to convert your live speech into text which it can interpret.
- Uses the Python pyttsx3 library to speak back to you in a human voice.
- Implemented a wake-word detection, meaning Gideon will only respond to your request if you start the sentence with the word "Gideon", simlar to "Hey Siri" and "Ok Google"
